Unknown if it is for neonatal encephalopath interventions or something

The covariate socio-demographic index appears to have no uncertainty for
these locations. This breaks the artifact building process due to

Indian states are determined programmatically by looking for location names
that contain India's location id in the path-to-global as well as either
'Urban' or 'Rural'.
